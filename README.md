# Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart attacks based on patient health data. The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven approaches can support medical decision-making by identifying risk factors and providing predictive insights.

The work is part of a collaborative academic project, structured to have clear documentation of workflow, methodology, and results.
